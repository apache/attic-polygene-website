# Apache Polygeneâ„¢ (Website)

> Landing pages built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
>
> Documentation built by the Apache Polygene sub-project's build systems


## How to work on content

First, install jekyll: `gem install jekyll`, then:

    cd $PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_THIS_FILE_IS_IN
    jekyll serve
    open http://localhost:4000/

You can now edit files in `./src` and refresh your browser to preview the changes locally.

### Working on future "blog" posts

Put your drafts in the `_drafts` directory and run jekyll with the `--drafts` command line
parameter. Once you're satisfied with your blog post, simply move it into the `_posts`
directory. Note that posts with dates in the future won't be rendered even if present in
the `_posts` directory.


## How to publish to polygene.apache.org

First, install jekyll: `gem install jekyll`, then:

    cd $PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_THIS_FILE_IS_IN
    jekyll build
    git add --force content src
    git commit -a -m  "polygene: update website"
    git push

## Landing pages

Only the news are in the Markdown format, the other pages that should rarely
change are plain HTML so we can fine-control the layout.

A news feed is built in **atom.xml** and the site map in **sitemap.txt**


## Sub-projects versionned documentation

Each Apache Polygene subproject should make its build system generate its documentation.
As part of its release process it should add its documentation to this very website.

### Apache Polygene (Java Edition)

The versioned documentation is generated from
[asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc) text files from the Polygene SDK
[source repository](http://polygene.apache.org/community/codebase.html) by its
[build system](http://polygene.apache.org/java/latest/build-system.html).
