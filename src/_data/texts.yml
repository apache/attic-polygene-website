    Apache Polygene™ is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
    Programming for domain centric application development. This includes
    evolved concepts from Aspect Oriented Programming, Dependency Injection
    and Domain Driven Design.

    Composite Oriented Programming allows developers to work with 'fragments',
    smaller than classes, and 'compose' fragments into larger 'composites'
    which acts like the regular objects. Apache Polygene™ also tackles the
    enforcement of application composition, i.e. composites are declared in
    modules, modules are contained in layers and access between layers are
    controlled/enforced.
