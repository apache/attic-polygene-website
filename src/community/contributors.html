        <h2>Contributors</h2>
        <p>
            There has been numerous contributors to the Polygene/Zest/Qi4j project over the years, and with risk of missing someone,
            we try to maintain this list to show our appreciation of these contributions.
        </p>
        <h3>Rickard &Ouml;berg</h3>
        <p>
            Rickard requires special mention, as a majority of the Core runtime implementation is written by him,
            and done so more than once (3 or 4 total re-writes) as our understanding for the problem space has improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rickard's achievements here and elsewhere (JBoss, XDoclet, Struts2), can not be understated. This project
            wouldn't exist without his spearheading insights and innovative thinking. Many of the core concepts, Mixins,
            Concerns and Constraints in particular, existed in his tool box long before Qi4j was formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rickard has moved on, working at Neo Technologies, helping out on the Neo4j project. But we are eternally
            grateful for his efforts here, and hope to see him come back one day in the future.
        </p>
