## Apache® Zest™ Renamed to Apache® Polygene™

Apache Zest is changing name to **Apache Polygene**. The change has been carried out
for the most part, and we are still in the process of encuring all naming is accurate
 going forward.
 
"The name change was triggered to prevent confusion with other similarly named software 
such as the visualization toolkit from Eclipse," said Niclas Hedhman, Vice President of 
Apache Polygene. "Since becoming an official ASF project, our codebase and community 
continue to flourish. We are confident that our new identity will reflect ongoing 
innovation and increased productivity."

With the name we want to communicate that Apache Polygene is polymorphic in nature,
and that it is possible to inherit traits in non-standard Java, yet using regular Java
and not a new language on top of the JVM.
